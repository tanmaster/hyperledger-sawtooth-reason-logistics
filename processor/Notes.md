ehm
right now trying to decode buffer payload.. works perfect for the xo example, problem is though for the education example not
now im kinda worried that i need to use protobufjs but probably i dont need to use it since i can just use normal buffer right?

tomorrow with tan i will run the python project locally and then lets see what it logs there :)













i need probably for the client the payload functions again to encode i could do some kind of npm library

!!after tp is done -> create rest api with nodejs/express



TODOS:
if protos not needed for processor, delete protos folder
create dockerfile for tp ->
