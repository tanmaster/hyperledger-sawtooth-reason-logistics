status: 
tp got transaction, can get and set. 
db models also right, 
start with eventsubscriber.
look at the streaming class -> do i really need to setup a serveR? i dont think so .. probably just connection between tp and subscriber but idk

db model: first save into blocks

          afterwards into specific tables
          tables below tables have to be inited first 




share code from repos .. 

https://demo.bitwise.io/fish/#!/
check if other exceptions from tp are also in the invalid transaction section.

what am i doing here?
    tans usecase: firma a ware x
    firma b scanned x 
    b angelangt durch scannen
    transpaerenz is key 

    save on blockchain only data which should be public
    user table:
    username, public, private encoded with hashed password 


also response from tp back to my graphl api if something went wrong..
also where todo validation of username?? in graph !!


i had simplewalletClient and education open

first docker-compose -f sawtooth yaml file up
then start tp
then start graphql api :)


Rename repo

Delete stuff with //Delete
