status: 
tp got transaction, can get and set. 
start with the supplyshitclient which reports to db?


check if other exceptions from tp are also in the invalid transaction section.

    tans usecase: firma a ware x
    firma b scanned x 
    b angelangt durch scannen
    transpaerenz is key 

    save on blockchain only data which should be public
    user table:
    username, public, private encoded with hashed password 


STATUS:
